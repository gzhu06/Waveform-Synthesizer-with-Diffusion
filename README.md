# Waveform Synthesizer with Diffusion Models (WIP)
(Self taught leanring materials) Diffusion based waveforom synthesizer. A collection or (re)implementations of interesting audio related diffusion models. Trainging framework is based on the [Diffwave repo](https://github.com/lmnt-com/diffwave). 

# TODO
- [ ] Unconditional diffusion
- [ ] Unconditional diffusion w and w/o guidance
- [ ] Conditional diffusion: Encoder(Conditioner) + Decoder(Vocoder)
- [ ] Notes

### Evaulation of Unconditional Generators
We compare different frameworks by testing on sc09 dataset using [unconditional audio generation benchmark repo](https://github.com/gzhu06/unconditional-waveform-synthesizer-with-diffusion).
